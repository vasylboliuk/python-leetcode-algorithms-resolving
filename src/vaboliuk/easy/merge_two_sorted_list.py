    Task: You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
        As a tech I would like to see one merged list.

        Note: This is not simple list this is liked list
    Examples:
        - Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
        - Input: list1 = [], list2 = [] Output: []
        - Input: list1 = [], list2 = [5 Output: [5]
